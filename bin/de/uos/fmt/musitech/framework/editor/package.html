The framework for building 
up and working with editors and on basic concrete editors.
<br>
<br> All editors should be subclasses of <code>AbstractEditor</code>.
<br> There are mainly two types of editors (which are themselves dirct subclasses
of <code>AbstractEditor</code>): 

<br> i) "Simple editors" (inherited from <code>AbstractSimpleEditor</code>) which have the task to 
edit a "simple" property of an object. "Simple" basically means that the editor can be displayed on one
single row i. e. have either a primite or a String to edit. Some "simple" objects
like <code>de.uos.fmt.musitech.utility.Rational</code> (which has only to properties)
meight get simple editors as well.

<br> ii) "Complex editors" (inherited from <code>AbstractComplexEditor</code>) which
have the task to edit more complex objects by using other editors for all
properties of the object. These other editors are called "children" of the complex editor.
(This mechanism can be used recursivly of course.) So a complex editor does not
contain any GUI for user input itself but rather display editors which have a GUI
for user input - either by being a simple editor or by containing children which
contain finnally simple editors as children.
<br>

<br> Another important distinction comes with the field <code>propertyName</code>
into play. This field contains the name of the <i>property</i> of the object to be edited.
If this field is null it is assumed that the edior stands for the given object itself.
These editors - refered to as "outmost editor" - should be the "root" editors 
which are themselves no children of any other editor. So changes are set to 
the so called <code>editObj</code> (object to be edited) directly - rather than
to the property with the name <code>propertyName</code> of <code>editObj</code>.
<br>

<br> Changes are applyed via reflection access in the simple editors.
These editors have a local copy of the property they edit (<code>propertyValue</code>)
and a <i>reference</i> to the object which has this property (<code>editObj</code>).
Notice that this object meight be a property of a more complex object.
<br>

<br> There is a panel (<code>EditorPanel</code>) having buttons for 
"OK", "Cancel" and "Apply" to be used for display of editors. This panel provides
the neccessary functionlity to react to these buttons. It can be put
into a <code>EditorWindow</code> which has an <code>EditorPanel</code>
and methods to set editors to it directly.
<br>

<br> The <code>EditorFactory</code> provides useful methods to get an instance
of either <code>AbstractComplexEditor</code> or <code>AbstractSimpleEditor</code>.
So if you only want to <i>use</i> editors you should not need to bother with
these <code>propertyName</code> and <code>editObj</code> things: just invoke
EditorFactory.createEdtior(Object).
<br>

<br> The interface <code>Editable</code> can be used to specify a specific profile
for an object. Such a profile is an instance of <code>EditorProfile</code>. 
<br>The EditorFactory uses these profiles if they exist.
