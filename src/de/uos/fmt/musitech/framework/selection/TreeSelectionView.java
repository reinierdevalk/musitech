MUSITECH LINKING EXCEPTION

Linking this library statically or dynamically with other modules is making
a combined work based on this library. Thus, the terms and conditions of the
GNU General Public License cover the whole combination.

As a special exception, the copyright holders of this library give you permission

of the license terms of these independent modules, and to copy and distribute the
resulting executable under terms of your choice, provided that you also meet,
for each linked independent module, the terms and conditions of the license of
that module. An independent module is a module which is not derived from or based
on this library.

For the MUSITECH library, this exceptional permission described in the paragraph
above is subject to the following three conditions:
- If you modify this library, you must extend the GNU General Public License and
       this exception including these conditions to your version of the MUSITECH library.
- If you distribute a combined work with this library, you have to mention the
       MUSITECH project and link to its web site www.musitech.org in a location
       easily accessible to the users of the combined work (typically in the "About"
       section of the "Help" menu) and in any advertising material for the combined
       software.
- If you distribute a combined work with the MUSITECH library, you allow the MUSITECH
               project to use mention your combined work for promoting the MUSITECH project.
