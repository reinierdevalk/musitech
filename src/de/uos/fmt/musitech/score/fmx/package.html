This package contains classes that provide support for music fonts used by the <i>gin </i> music notation module. 
<i>fmx</i> is an abbreviation for <i>font mextrics</i>, a main design concept of the notation generator. Most fix
musical symbols like clefs, noteheads and accidentals are provided by a font. The default font is called <i>gin.ttf</i>.
During all computations gin doesn't need to know the shape of any symbol (also called <i>glyph</i>). It only needs 
information about the shapes' bounding boxes, consiting of width, height and depth. The set of all bounding box
information is called <i>font metric</i> and stored in an fmx-file (default: <i>gin.fmx</i>).
